# Cloud Burst

## Project Overview
The Cloud Burst Prediction & Forecasting System is an advanced, AI-powered solution that combines historical weather data, real-time IoT sensor inputs, and deep learning models to provide precise, localized predictions of extreme rainfall events. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning techniques with comprehensive meteorological data sources, the system offers a sophisticated early warning mechanism for potential cloud burst incidents.

## Repository Structure
This repository appears to contain the following key components:

1. **research-cloud-burst**: A submodule that contains research-related files and resources.
2. **ui-cloud-burst**: A submodule that likely holds the user interface and visualization components.
